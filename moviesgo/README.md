# Getting Started with Create React App

A simple Web-App imitation of the Imdb.com
The only functionalities are:
    -Search a movie
    -Click the movie, to procceed to an information page

The styling of the Web App was made using bootstrap.

The app is made by dividing it into the components below:

    -index.js
    -App.js
    -MovieBrowsing.jsx
    -DetailsPage.jsx
    -Card.jsx
